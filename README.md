# twitter-usernames-wordlist

This is a wordlist of recently active twitter users.  It was compiled via a python
spider and will continue to grow.  The Twitter API sets a limit on how many queries you can
perform in a 24-hour period.

There is a size limit of 25M, and the zip is around 105M currently, so the new zip has been uploaded as a release. Click the link under NEW RELEASE below for download.
